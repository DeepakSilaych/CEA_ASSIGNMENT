            <h1>Motivation for the Post</h1>
            <div>
                I am passionate about programming and keep looking forward to try my hands on different domains of coding. Web development is one of them. Being a part of the web secretary 
                could provide opportunities to work on exciting projects, gain experience in the 
                field and motivation to get more knowledge. <br> It provides a platform for me to learn 
                from those who have more knowledge and experience in the field.<br>
                As a being part of department council, I will get to bond with allot of 
                seniors and upcoming batchmates of the department which is the biggest motivation 
                of me for this post. <br>
                I will get to make relationships with allot of seniors as well as upcoming
                batchmates in the department, this is the primary reason why I am motivated to 
                take up this position. It provides a platform for me to learn from those who have 
                more knowledge and experience in the field, and also to guide and mentor those who 
                are just starting out. Building these connections and relationships within the 
                department can lead to a more supportive and collaborative environment, where 
                everyone can work together towards common goals and achieve success.

            <h1>Past Experience</h1>
            <div>
                I have been involved in coding during my school year,  During 7th-10th I had learnt basics of multiple languages including Python, Java, CPP, SQL, JavaScript, very basics of Numpy and Pandas some as part of curriculum of school other as side interest <br>(Though I donâ€™t remember most of it now). 
                <br> I have done some basic web projects during annual science exhibition. <br> <br>
                In insti, I got back on coding after break during JEE with CS101.
                And continued this by participating in Hacker rank, Devcom Projects (Full Stack Web Dev) and Code wars.
